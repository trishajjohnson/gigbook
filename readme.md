# GiGBOOK docs

GiGBOOK is a database driven application utilizing the external Ticketmaster API.  It provides users the ability to search for music venues in a specific geographical location.  

Users may register and create a profile, which will be saved into the database.  Cities, states and countries are also tables in the database.  Once registerd, a user may login with their proper credentials, edit their profile, search venues and save/remove to/from their favorites list, also a table in the database.
